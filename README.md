How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
From communications with the user, we create user stories. From these user stories, we create test cases. Once the developed product is able to pass or meet all test cases, we consider the product done. The user stories help user create specific goals or objectives.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I try to plan as well as I can. One hour of planning can save you ten hours of fixing bugs. However, studying Agile got me thinking of two things. First it got me to make more of an attempt to see my product or my code through the eyes of the user. Second, I began to think more about increment planning on a larger scaled product. If you can compartmentalize your product, you woundln't have to plan it all at once. Your planning can come in waves.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
I think good team members need to have to have two traits. They need to be accountable and teachable. You need to be accountable for your responsibilites and your mistakes. If someone doesn't do their job and they're lying about it, the whole team suffers. You need to be teachable such that if you are given a task you are not comfortable with, you need to be able to speak up and ask for assistance. You also need to be able to see when someone is instructing you, not criticizing you.
